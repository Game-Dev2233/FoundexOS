# FoundexOS
FoundexOS is a simple OS written mainly in C  as a simple OS meant to be a simple hobby because I wanted to make it
# Goals
A simple FAT32 filesystem support and A TCC port with a assembler and simple Command line so I can add on to the OS from scratch
# ARCHIVED AS OF 9/10/23
I have decided to Archive This Repo In Favor Of My Other project Phoenix OS as Phoenix OS has a simple CLI and has commands unlike FoundexOS
